                <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
                <p>AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks done by humans, including customer service work, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control. In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks much better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks, such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors. Because of the massive data sets it can process, AI can also give enterprises insights into their operations.</p>

                <h1>Data Science</h1>
                <p>Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Modern organizations are inundated with data; there is a proliferation of devices that can automatically collect and store information.

                <h1>Software Development</h1>
                <p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. There are three basic types:System software to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.Programming software to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.</p>
